        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Here's my version for a quick veggie pizza, based on the combinations offered by many pizza chains. You can make adjustments to the quantities and choice of vegetables depending on what you like.</p>
        
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
           <li>1 (12 inch) pre-baked pizza crust</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
           <li>1 cup seasoned tomato sauce</li>
           <li>½ cup sliced onion</li>
           <li>1 cup fresh sliced mushrooms</li>
           <li>½ cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
           <li>¼ cup chopped black olives</li>
           <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place the pizza crust on a large cookie tray or pizza pan. Brush the crust evenly with olive oil. Spread tomato sauce over it with a spatula or back of a spoon. Sprinkle vegetables evenly over the sauce, and top with cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until cheese has melted and is bubbly. Let cool for 2 to 3 minutes before cutting.</li>
        </ol>
